## Kinidymos, Hunter of the Undivided
When the inner becomes outer, and the upper becomes lower, when the male and female form the single-backed child whose eyes are replete with eyes and whose image is in place of an image, then you will enter the kingdom. These sidereal psychopomps will lead all matter to the monad and terminal oneness, it is the duty of the kinidymos to ensure this never happens.

***Possessions***
- Dyadic compass
- Disunional sword
- One weapon of Choice
- Lead manacles

***Skills***
3 Disunial Sword Fighting  
2 Weapon Skill of choice  
2 Sneak  
2 Second Sight  
1 Swim OR Climb OR Disguise  
1 Tracking  

**Item: Dyadic Compass**
To the uninitiated this is just a broken compass in a small box, but to the kinidymos and those familiar with their ways it is a precision tool. Test your Second Sight while focusing on the needle to have it direct you towards a point of magical conflux within 6 miles. If multiple points exist it will point the the strongest, which will usually be the kinidymos' quarry.

**Item: Disunional Sword** ***#**
The sinister and iconic tool of the hunters of the holy hermaphrodites, made of the basest metal to ensure their separation and descent. The lead blade is as long as a typical longsword's, but its girth and long handle make it look stubby. On a Fumble the weapon is bent out of shape and counts as a mace until repaired.

## Proxy Child
One day you woke up in the arms of a giant, singed and lolling in its arms. You thought of how nice it would be to stretch your legs, and it put you down. You had trouble walking and felt that maybe this was a hasty decision, it put you on its shoulders. And so on and so on until this point in this place. You are still learning and still making mistakes, but your companion is always there for you, to pick you up again.

***Possessions***
- A compression suit
- A pouch containing interesting things you’ve found since you woke up, most notably a: (d6)
    1) stuffed animal, though it’s unclear what that animal is
    2) rubber ball that unerringly returns to the hand that throws it
    3) collection of small bones strung together to make a functional puppet. The strings are long enough to stretch to the floor from the shoulders of your Proxy
    4) small furry mammal which refuses to do as you say no matter how hard you think
    5) rusty pistolet with no energy, useful for pretending to shoot the wild animals your Proxy often defends you against
    6) crown you made from a bit of the scrap you woke up surrounded by. It has markings on it that you can’t read.
- A 7ft tall companion who is moved by your will alone:
    - Ceramic Proxy
        - Surgical white (or vividly coloured) plates form the skin of this bipedal behemoth, sliding over each other with the gentle sound of bare feet on sand. Someone made it with an eye to detail, every inch of it is an aesthetic treat.
        - Always has 3 armour
- OR an
    - Organic Proxy
        - To a casual observer it could be mistaken for a particularly large person, with a barrel chest, cabled arms and a square head. But once they spot those dull eyes it’s clear this is just a puppet. They are capable of speech, though only at your command.
- OR a
    - Mechanical Proxy
        - An unsubtle conglomeration of articulated metal, its every movement grinds and twangs. This is a functional machine, made without the arrogance of a hominid form. It might be stooped and chicken-like, or a great wheel of arms and legs. Its form is up to you. Always counts as being armed with a weapon of your choice and has 3 skill in its use.

***Skills***
**Proxy**
5 Strength  
2 Climb  
2 Run  
2 Heal  
2 Swim  
**Child**
2 Second Sight  
1 Spell - Random (Table 5)  
1 Spell - Random (Table 5)  

***Special***
The Child starts with 2 Skill and 8 Stamina and counts as an oversized item for inventory purposes when carried (they are rather small and feeble). The Proxy is rolled as you would a normal character. They both share a common Luck pool.
The Child may use their own Advanced Skills for any action the Proxy takes, including magic in which case they may also use its Stamina to cast it.
The Proxy ceases to function if it loses all Stamina, is out of sight of the child for more than an hour, or is encased in lead or silver.
The Proxy heals naturally like any other character, regardless of its construction. It can also be Healed (or repaired).
If the Child dies the Proxy ceases to function. If the proxy dies the child is very sad and lonely.

## Homesick Deity
You were once lord or lady of all you surveyed: a god embodying one or more of the natural forces of your world and revered by the mortal inhabitants. When your world withered and died on some unfortunate alignment of the spheres, you were fortunate enough to come unstuck and survived. You are certainly a shadow of your former self, but then you were literally a divine incarnation before so perhaps you should be happy with what you’re left with, eh? You are, of course, still a little hung-up about the homeworld. That’s understandable.

***Possessions***
- A badly damaged but still functionally excellent weapon of your choice, granting +1 to attacks made with it.
- A drinking horn with 4 gulps of Ambroise and Nectar in it (each drink counts as a provision that also restores 1 Luck) OR a rather gaudy set of statuettes depicting you and your other playmates on the pantheon.

***Skills***
1 Astrology  
2 Second Sight  
2 Weapon Fighting with the weapon of your choice  
2 Spell – Random (Table 5, Troika!)  
2 Spell – Animate  

***Special***
Being without your home turf advantage may have severely lessened your divine abilities, but you are still very much above the norm. You aren’t immortal or omniscient anymore, but once per day you can spend a luck point to impose your divinity on your surroundings. This might involve commanding an unusually recalcitrant object nearby to behave (and having it listen), or impressing the mortal proles. Said proles may test their luck against being compelled to worship you for at least 1d6 days. And who knows, perhaps they’ll end up liking your church better than their old one.

## Caped Crusader
You were chasing your nemesis from Metroville City after what must have been your hundredth high-powered punch up in the downtown area. This time, however, with an evil cackle he opened some sort of aperture in front of you, which you flew straight into like the great big do-gooding doofus that you are. Now you’re adrift on the cosmic currents, and trying to adapt to a life without the precious city you swore to protect. Best not to worry too much about whatever it is your nemesis is doing in your absence.

***Possessions***
- A very gaudy, skin tight costume complete with cape.
- A communication device for the League of Heroic Chums, which has picked up only static since you passed through the portal.

***Skills***
4 Fly  
4 Strength  
3 Fist Fighting  
1 Awareness  
1 Disguise  

***Special***
You don’t wear armour, but you a mild invulnerability to harm. You count as Heavily Armoured, without the associated encumbrance. Additionally you must roll 1d6 to determine your secret and mortal weakness: 1 - a kind of shiny space-rock chemically similar to your homeworld; 2 - anything that’s a particular shade of green; 3 - plasmic core fumes; 4 - sour dairy products, including cheese and off-milk; 5 - light produced from a magical source; 6 - nuts. Whenever the subject of your secret and mortal weakness is brought near to you, you lose 2 points of skill until it is removed, and lose a point of stamina every round (or every few seconds) it is near.

## Broker Envoy
There are a number of powerful forces in the multiverse, and a number of conflicts, checks and balances that exist between them. Your magical powers and abilities were bartered and cajoled from greater beings by acting as a diplomat, negotiator and broker between them. You consider yourself as a Specialist agent of the cosmic balance, having survived encounters with strange and mercurial forces of the cosmos. Others more likely consider you a wheedling con-man, try-hard, or brown-noser.

***Possessions***
- 1d6 sigil-badges, the first your personal crest and each other representative of a patron OR Specialist subject.
- Diplomats robe and cloak, subtly padded out. Lightly Armoured.
- Impressive-looking staff
- Tea set for impromptu summits

***Skills***

## Wizard Tower Thief
You grew up with ambitions for a career in sorcery, but unfortunately you also grew up without demonstrating a single iota of magical talent. Working initially on the premise that if you can’t have it, no one can, you set about pilfering interesting magical lore and spellbooks. You have worked out by now the fundamentals of eking out the residual magic in objects taken from spellcasters, but refinement is a long way off.

***Possessions***
- Burglars outfit with deceptively deep pockets, giving an additional 2 inventory slots that can be used without incurring weight penalties.
- Climbing gear, for those damnable tall bookshelves.
- 2d6 random magical nicknacks and spell scrolls you have recently liberated from an uncaring home.

***Skills***
4 Awareness  
4 Evaluate  
2 Sneak  
2 Locks  
2 Trapping  
2 Activate Magic Spells  

***Special***
You may use your skill Activate Magic Spells to use up a written spell as found in a wizard's spellbook, scroll or magic item. You can still use items with magic abilities as normal, but if for whatever reason it isn’t working, you can jimmy some sort of dramatic reaction out of it with a little fiddling and persistence. Whenever you use an item this way, roll 1d6. On a 1, it explodes and deals you 1d3 damage. On a 2, 3, 4 or 5 it’s magical residue is used up without any fireworks, rendering it inert. On a 6 it still has a little juice left in it, and is usable again.

## Ork Gangerman
You are the defacto leader of a workteam of Orks, tasked with all manner of unsavoury tasks from killing things with impunity to clearing out a really, really messy house. You’re not the leader down to your charisma or tactical acumen, but rather because you’re the biggest and strongest Ork in your crew.

***Possessions***
- A Stout and gnarly Club
- 2d6 Ork lackeys brimming with fear and loathing for their leader.
- Bone knife, made from your last Ork leader’s femur.
- Knuckle-dice

***Skills***
4 Strength  
2 Fist Fighting  
2 Club Fighting  
2 Menace  

***Special***
While arguably one of the least intelligent of the intelligent species, Orks mental power far exceeds that of their peers in other ways. When a large enough group of Orks believes a thing to be true their inherent link to the powers of chaos warps reality and makes it so. You can make a strength check to cow as many surrounding Orks as possible, and if the number of cowed Orks exceeds 2d6 you can assert your will over nearby reality. You get the benefits of a Lucky Assertion without spending the luck points, except that other non-cowed characters in-game might be baffled by it.

## Undercity Denizen
You had a life now long forgotten as a mundane mortal in one of the many metropolises on the material plane. But you slipped through the cracks, faded from the street level, and the bleak otherworld of the undercity caught you in its grasp. Now you walk the spaces unseen and deal in circles which only the truly certifiable can deal, like a particularly pungent shaman of the city.

***Possessions***
- A bag of assorted tribble and rubbish wrapped fast to a stout length of wood
- An unkempt and ragged outfit that manages somehow to express an air of nobility while simultaneously dirtying the actual air with a mysterious but powerful odour.

***Skills***
2 Fist Fighting  
4 Awareness  
4 Second Sight  
2 Spell - Astral Reach  
2 Spell - Illusion  
2 Spell - Random  

***Special***
Since to any common passerby you appear to be nothing more than a crazy homeless person you have 4 Sneak when in Urban areas, while all the well to do citizens of the City Above desperately avoid making eye contact with you. Doesn’t apply to others awakened to the Undercity.

## Chapter Knight of the Grand Sanctum
As a child barely old enough to read you were dropped into the greatest library in the million spheres, trained as a powerful protector and charged with guarding and curating one of the many areas that intersect with another world. Of course, these days literacy rates are very low and interest in the public services wanes. You have left your post (or else been laid off amidst huge cuts) and set out to discover if there really is anything more to the world than your dusty tomes.

***Possessions***
- An enchanted sword, providing +2 damage against those with late fees.
- A quick cheat sheet on the Grand Sanctum’s rather complicated index system.
- A suit of librarian’s Tweed-mail, thickly woven Modest Armour.

***Skills***
2 Sword Fighting  
2 Sneak  
1 Astrology  
1 Organize  

## Feeble-pit Survivor
Maybe because you were too pretty or charming or just plain unfortunate, you were taken by the royal guard one night and for weeks, months or possibly even years you survived the expansive and diabolical dungeon of Feeble Ezra, the Crown Prince of Philomere. It took some skill but you’ll be the first to admit that you only really got by on tightly-wound paranoia and sheer dumb luck. Eventually a newly-placed magical trap misfired and teleported you away, but honestly you aren’t yet wholly sure that this isn’t all some further dastardly trap by the Feeble Prince.

***Possessions***
- Manacles and a length of chain
- Ragged and soiled prisoners clothes
- An expertly crafted shiv

***Skills***
4 Trapping  
4 Awareness  
4 Run  
2 Stealth  

***Special***
You are so fuelled by neurotic terror that you’ve become desensitised to the horrors of the world. You don’t spend a luck point when testing against fear related effects. Of course, if you ever manage to chill out again this bonus is lost.

## Pail Possessor
You once had nothing to your name. That was until a stray bucket fell on your head. Now, you have a pail and/or amnesia (but probably just the pail). The question arises; what does one do with a magic bucket? The answer: adventure.

***Possessions***
- A magic pail
- The clothes on your back (and other body parts)

***Skills***
3 Bucket Fighting  
2 Strength  
1 Spell – Summon Pail  
1 Run  

***Special***
Only you can use the pail; the pail chose you. To all others it is just a regular bucket.

**Item: Magic Pail**
The pail appears empty, however, when you make a motion as if you were throwing out its contents, a random substance will materialise and be thrown out of the pail. E.g. you come across a fire, swing the bucket towards the fire and out of the bucket is thrown a bucket’s-worth of water which douses said fire. If you place an item in the bucket, it will disappear only to reappear when you throw the bucket again. You can only place one item (GM’s discretion for what counts as a single item) at a time in the bucket, any subsequent items will either be spat out or destroyed (Again, at the GM’s discretion). The bucket still only takes up 1 equipment slot with an item in it.

**Example Substances**
1. Silver Pellets
2. Oil
3. Pebbles
4. Salt
5. Confetti
6. Ants

**Skill: Bucket Fighting**
In melee you may swing the pail at enemies to deal damage as a club might (Without the benefit of Heavy Percussive Weapon). A ranged attack would be throwing a substance out of the bucket.

**Spell: Summon Pail (2)**
If you ever lose the pail you can use this to summon it again. What are you if not the pail possessor? The pail may or may not fall on your head when it is summoned

## Miracle Cure Salesmen
You were the only survivor of an expedition to the fountain of youth, and you’ve carried back as much of the legendary waters with you as you could carry. However, eternity is proving too short a time to make your fortune hawking your miraculous wares. You meander from sphere to sphere, seeking out the desperate and the gullible after being laughed out of throne rooms and grand halls.
