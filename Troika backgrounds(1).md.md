<h2 id="good-dog">Good Dog</h2>
<p>You’re not a magic dog, you’re not a talking dog, but you are a good dog.</p>
<p><em><strong>Possessions</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li>A neckerchief OR a collar and half a leash OR your favourite ball</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Skills</strong></em><br>

2 Run<br>
2 Track<br>
2 Sneak<br>
2 Swim<br>
1 Sleight of Hand<br>
1 Tunnel Fighting<br>
1 Bite Fighting</p>
<p><em><strong>Special</strong></em><br>
Decide if you are, in addition to being a good dog, a big dog OR a small dog. Big dogs get +1 Bite Fighting and +1 Dig, small dogs get +1 Tunnel Fighting and +1 Awareness. May only carry half the normal number of items. Has all predictable dog related limitations, like not being able to wield a sword. May however cast magic is you find someone that can teach dogs to do it. Good luck with that.</p>

<h2 id="kinidymos-hunter-of-the-undivided">Kinidymos, Hunter of the Undivided</h2>
<p>When the inner becomes outer, and the upper becomes lower, when the male and female form the single-backed child whose eyes are replete with eyes and whose image is in place of an image, then you will enter the kingdom. These sidereal psychopomps will lead all matter to the monad and terminal oneness, it is the duty of the kinidymos to ensure this never happens.</p>
<p><em><strong>Possessions</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li>Dyadic compass</li>
<li>Disunional sword</li>
<li>One weapon of Choice</li>
<li>Lead manacles</li>

3 Disunial Sword Fighting<br>
2 Weapon Skill of choice<br>
2 Sneak<br>
2 Second Sight<br>
1 Swim OR Climb OR Disguise<br>
1 Tracking</p>
<p><strong>Item: Dyadic Compass</strong><br>
To the uninitiated this is just a broken compass in a small box, but to the kinidymos and those familiar with their ways it is a precision tool. Test your Second Sight while focusing on the needle to have it direct you towards a point of magical conflux within 6 miles. If multiple points exist it will point the the strongest, which will usually be the kinidymos’ quarry.</p>
<p><strong>Item: Disunional Sword</strong> *<strong>#</strong><br>
The sinister and iconic tool of the hunters of the holy hermaphrodites, made of the basest metal to ensure their separation and descent. The lead blade is as long as a typical longsword’s, but its girth and long handle make it look stubby. On a Fumble the weapon is bent out of shape and counts as a mace until repaired.</p>

<h2 id="proxy-child">Proxy Child</h2>
<p>One day you woke up in the arms of a giant, singed and lolling in its arms. You thought of how nice it would be to stretch your legs, and it put you down. You had trouble walking and felt that maybe this was a hasty decision, it put you on its shoulders. And so on and so on until this point in this place. You are still learning and still making mistakes, but your companion is always there for you, to pick you up again.</p>
<p><em><strong>Possessions</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li>A compression suit</li>
<li>A pouch containing interesting things you’ve found since you woke up, most notably a: (d6)
<ol>
<li>stuffed animal, though it’s unclear what that animal is</li>
<li>rubber ball that unerringly returns to the hand that throws it</li>
<li>collection of small bones strung together to make a functional puppet. The strings are long enough to stretch to the floor from the shoulders of your Proxy</li>
<li>small furry mammal which refuses to do as you say no matter how hard you think</li>
<li>rusty pistolet with no energy, useful for pretending to shoot the wild animals your Proxy often defends you against</li>
<li>crown you made from a bit of the scrap you woke up surrounded by. It has markings on it that you can’t read.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>A 7ft tall companion who is moved by your will alone:
<ul>
<li>Ceramic Proxy
<ul>
<li>Surgical white (or vividly coloured) plates form the skin of this bipedal behemoth, sliding over each other with the gentle sound of bare feet on sand. Someone made it with an eye to detail, every inch of it is an aesthetic treat.</li>
<li>Always has 3 armour</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>OR an
<ul>
<li>Organic Proxy
<ul>
<li>To a casual observer it could be mistaken for a particularly large person, with a barrel chest, cabled arms and a square head. But once they spot those dull eyes it’s clear this is just a puppet. They are capable of speech, though only at your command.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>OR a
<ul>
<li>Mechanical Proxy
<ul>
<li>An unsubtle conglomeration of articulated metal, its every movement grinds and twangs. This is a functional machine, made without the arrogance of a hominid form. It might be stooped and chicken-like, or a great wheel of arms and legs. Its form is up to you. Always counts as being armed with a weapon of your choice and has 3 skill in its use.</li>

1 Spell - Random (Table 5)</p>
<p><em><strong>Special</strong></em><br>
The Child starts with 2 Skill and 8 Stamina and counts as an oversized item for inventory purposes when carried (they are rather small and feeble). The Proxy is rolled as you would a normal character. They both share a common Luck pool.<br>
The Child may use their own Advanced Skills for any action the Proxy takes, including magic in which case they may also use its Stamina to cast it.<br>
The Proxy ceases to function if it loses all Stamina, is out of sight of the child for more than an hour, or is encased in lead or silver.<br>
The Proxy heals naturally like any other character, regardless of its construction. It can also be Healed (or repaired).<br>
If the Child dies the Proxy ceases to function. If the proxy dies the child is very sad and lonely.</p>

<h2 id="homesick-deity">Homesick Deity</h2>
<p>You were once lord or lady of all you surveyed: a god embodying one or more of the natural forces of your world and revered by the mortal inhabitants. When your world withered and died on some unfortunate alignment of the spheres, you were fortunate enough to come unstuck and survived. You are certainly a shadow of your former self, but then you were literally a divine incarnation before so perhaps you should be happy with what you’re left with, eh? You are, of course, still a little hung-up about the homeworld. That’s understandable.</p>
<p><em><strong>Possessions</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li>A badly damaged but still functionally excellent weapon of your choice, granting +1 to attacks made with it.</li>

<p><em><strong>Special</strong></em><br>
Being without your home turf advantage may have severely lessened your divine abilities, but you are still very much above the norm. You aren’t immortal or omniscient anymore, but once per day you can spend a luck point to impose your divinity on your surroundings. This might involve commanding an unusually recalcitrant object nearby to behave (and having it listen), or impressing the mortal proles. Said proles may test their luck against being compelled to worship you for at least 1d6 days. And who knows, perhaps they’ll end up liking your church better than their old one.</p>
<h2 id="caped-crusader">Caped Crusader</h2>
<p>You were chasing your nemesis from Metroville City after what must have been your hundredth high-powered punch up in the downtown area. This time, however, with an evil cackle he opened some sort of aperture in front of you, which you flew straight into like the great big do-gooding doofus that you are. Now you’re adrift on the cosmic currents, and trying to adapt to a life without the precious city you swore to protect. Best not to worry too much about whatever it is your nemesis is doing in your absence.</p>
<p><em><strong>Possessions</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li>A very gaudy, skin tight costume complete with cape.</li>

Additionally you must roll 1d6 to determine your secret and mortal weakness: 1 - a kind of shiny space-rock chemically similar to your homeworld; 2 - anything that’s a particular shade of green; 3 - plasmic core fumes; 4 - sour dairy products, including cheese and off-milk; 5 - light produced from a magical source; 6 - nuts.

<h2 id="wizard-tower-thief">Wizard Tower Thief</h2>
<p>You grew up with ambitions for a career in sorcery, but unfortunately you also grew up without demonstrating a single iota of magical talent. Working initially on the premise that if you can’t have it, no one can, you set about pilfering interesting magical lore and spellbooks. You have worked out by now the fundamentals of eking out the residual magic in objects taken from spellcasters, but refinement is a long way off.</p>

<p><em><strong>Special</strong></em><br>
You may use your skill Activate Magic Spells to use up a written spell as found in a wizard’s spellbook, scroll or magic item. You can still use items with magic abilities as normal, but if for whatever reason it isn’t working, you can jimmy some sort of dramatic reaction out of it with a little fiddling and persistence. Whenever you use an item this way, roll 1d6. On a 1, it explodes and deals you 1d3 damage. On a 2, 3, 4 or 5 it’s magical residue is used up without any fireworks, rendering it inert. On a 6 it still has a little juice left in it, and is usable again.</p>
<h2 id="ork-gangerman">Ork Gangerman</h2>
<p>You are the defacto leader of a workteam of Orks, tasked with all manner of unsavoury tasks from killing things with impunity to clearing out a really, really messy house. You’re not the leader down to your charisma or tactical acumen, but rather because you’re the biggest and strongest Ork in your crew.</p>
<p><em><strong>Possessions</strong></em></p>

While arguably one of the least intelligent of the intelligent species, Orks mental power far exceeds that of their peers in other ways. When a large enough group of Orks believes a thing to be true their inherent link to the powers of chaos warps reality and makes it so. You can make a strength check to cow as many surrounding Orks as possible, and if the number of cowed Orks exceeds 2d6 you can assert your will over nearby reality. You get the benefits of a Lucky Assertion without spending the luck points, except that other non-cowed characters in-game might be baffled by it.</p>
<h2 id="undercity-denizen">Undercity Denizen</h2>

<h2 id="pail-possessor">Pail Possessor</h2>
<p>You once had nothing to your name. That was until a stray bucket fell on your head. Now, you have a pail and/or amnesia (but probably just the pail). The question arises; what does one do with a magic bucket? The answer: adventure.</p>
<p><em><strong>Possessions</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li>A magic pail</li>
<li>The clothes on your back (and other body parts)</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Skills</strong></em><br>
3 Bucket Fighting<br>
2 Strength<br>
1 Spell – Summon Pail<br>
1 Run</p>
<p><em><strong>Special</strong></em><br>
Only you can use the pail; the pail chose you. To all others it is just a regular bucket.</p>
<p><strong>Item: Magic Pail</strong><br>
The pail appears empty, however, when you make a motion as if you were throwing out its contents, a random substance will materialise and be thrown out of the pail. E.g. you come across a fire, swing the bucket towards the fire and out of the bucket is thrown a bucket’s-worth of water which douses said fire. If you place an item in the bucket, it will disappear only to reappear when you throw the bucket again. You can only place one item (GM’s discretion for what counts as a single item) at a time in the bucket, any subsequent items will either be spat out or destroyed (Again, at the GM’s discretion). The bucket still only takes up 1 equipment slot with an item in it.</p>
<p><strong>Example Substances</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Silver Pellets</li>
<li>Oil</li>
<li>Pebbles</li>
<li>Salt</li>
<li>Confetti</li>
<li>Ants</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Skill: Bucket Fighting</strong><br>
In melee you may swing the pail at enemies to deal damage as a club might (Without the benefit of Heavy Percussive Weapon). A ranged attack would be throwing a substance out of the bucket.</p>
<p><strong>Spell: Summon Pail (2)</strong><br>
If you ever lose the pail you can use this to summon it again. What are you if not the pail possessor? The pail may or may not fall on your head when it is summoned</p>
